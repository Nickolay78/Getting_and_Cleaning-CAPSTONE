Run_analysis.R creates FinalData.txt which contains tidy data according to project requirements.

Dataset downloaded from the folder “getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset”

Data assigned to follow variables:
1)	features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
2)	activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
3)	subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
4)	x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
5)	y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
6)	subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
7)	x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
8)	y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

Creating one dataset by merging test and training sets
ROW BINDING
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
COLOMN BINDING
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Selecting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns)

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
“Acc” to “Accelerometer”
“Gyro” to “Gyroscope”
“BodyBody“ to  “Body”
“Mag” to “Magnitude”
“f*” to “Frequency”
“t*”  to “Time”

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
